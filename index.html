            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I spent the first 25 years of my life completely dedicated to football. Once my professional career ended due to injury, I had no clue what to do with myself. I stumbled into web development while trying to figure out what the google analytics tag I was using for my website actually meant, and fell in love with it. I will be graduating from the UNC Coding Bootcamp in December as a full-stack web developer and cannot wait to continue to learn and grow as a developer as I attack challenges with the same persistence and tenacity I had as a football player.

            <p>
                I have just started working on my own to create some content for my portfolio. I will also be adding projects from my coursework as they are assigned. Unfortunately, for now, my portfolio is empty. Come back soon!
